# a-social-network

> Based on my previous [building-facebook](https://github.com/gferrarocamus/building-facebook) project, this site is a social network built with Ruby on Rails in the style of Facebook, where users can sign up, friend other users, and share posts.

## Features
* Sign up with your actual Facebook account or create an account prodiving email and password
* Search for other users and send them friend requests
* Get notifications when someone sends you a friend request
* Create text or image posts
* See, like, and comment on your friends' posts

## Install

In order to run the site, you need to have [Ruby on Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.0/getting_started.html#installing-rails) installed. Then you can clone this repository and install the needed gems:
```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:
```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, fire up a local server:
```
$ rails server
```
